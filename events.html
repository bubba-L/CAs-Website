            <p style="color: yellow;" class="eventsP">
                The smaller creators deserve to be recognized too. This is my biggest (and most expensive project) 
                so if you or any other communities you are a part of under 20k followers this is your invite. 
                We will premier top clips, fan art, and even fully custom and dedicated music for this event.

                A massive event where multiple communities come together to showcase their favorite up-and-coming streamers. 
                Over the course of a few hours, we review best clips, funniest moments, most hype chat interactions, and overall 
                stream energy to determine who has the most potential to be the next big thing (Other superlatives will be included as 
                well)

                A high-stakes 1v1 tournament where participants don't know what games they'll compete in ahead of time.
