        <h3 class="indentTxt" id="what">What are the Creator Awards?</h3>

        <p class="centerTxt"> We believe small creators deserve to be seen just as much OR EVEN MORE 
            than big full time creators. Artists deserve to be recognized, small creators deserve to be recognized, and 
            programmers deserve to be recognized. Without these people the streaming and content world would be bland and basic. 
            Small creators who go to work every day, go to school full time, and have other obligations are the hardest working 
            people on the planet. They have passions that push them to work on what they love even when they have little to no 
            time whatsoever! <br> <strong>You deserve recognition</strong>.</p>
